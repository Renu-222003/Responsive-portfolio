        <p>Hi there! I’m Renu, a budding front-end developer excited to embark on my journey in the
          world of web development. With a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I’m passionate about creating
          beautiful and user-friendly websites that make a lasting impression. As a recent graduate, I’ve honed my skills
          through hands-on projects and coursework, where I learned the importance of responsive design and accessibility. I
          love turning ideas into reality and am eager to tackle new challenges that allow me to grow and learn.</p>
        <p> In this portfolio, you’ll find a selection of my projects that reflect my creativity and dedication to
          delivering quality work. I’m always looking to expand my knowledge and stay updated with the latest trends in
          front-end development.I’m excited to connect with like-minded individuals and explore opportunities to contribute
          to innovative projects. Let’s create something amazing together!

        <h2>Our Story</h2> <br> <br>
        <p>Welcome to <strong>[Renoria's Bakers]</strong>, where passion meets tradition! Founded in
          <strong>[2015]</strong>, our bakery has been dedicated to crafting delicious baked goods that bring joy to our
          community. Our founder, <strong>[vandana chanoria]</strong>, started this journey with a simple dream: to share
          the love of baking with everyone.
        </p>
    
        <p>From a small kitchen to a bustling bakery, our journey has been filled with love, hard work, and a commitment to
          quality. We believe that baking is not just a profession; it’s an art form that requires creativity, precision,
          and a sprinkle of magic. Every loaf of bread, every cake, and every pastry is made with the utmost care and
          attention to detail.</p>
    
        <p>At <strong>[Renoria's bakers]</strong>, we use only the finest ingredients, sourced locally whenever possible, to
          ensure that every bite is fresh and flavorful. Our flour is milled from the best grains, our eggs are farm-fresh,
          and our fruits are handpicked at their peak ripeness. We take pride in supporting local farmers and suppliers,
          believing that great baking starts with great ingredients.</p>
    
        <p>Our menu features a delightful array of baked goods, from classic recipes that have stood the test of time to
          innovative creations that reflect the changing seasons and trends. Whether you’re craving a rich chocolate cake,
          flaky croissants, or artisanal bread, we have something to satisfy every palate.</p>
    
        <p>But our story is not just about the products we create; it’s about the community we serve. We cherish the
          relationships we build with our customers, many of whom have become like family. We love to celebrate special
          moments with you, whether it’s a birthday, wedding, or just a sweet treat to brighten your day. Your smiles and
          feedback inspire us to keep improving and innovating.</p>
    
        <p>As we look to the future, our mission remains the same: to create delicious, high-quality baked goods that bring
          people together. We invite you to join us on this journey, to share in our passion for baking, and to experience
          the warmth and joy that comes from a freshly baked treat. Thank you for being a part of our story!</p>

                <h2> Why User Experience Matters</h2>
                <p>
                  User experience (UX) is all about how easy and enjoyable it is for people to use a website. A good website
                  design makes it simple for visitors to find what they need and navigate through the site. When a website is
                  user-friendly, people are more likely to stay longer and explore more pages, which can lead to more sales or
                  sign-ups. Key features like mobile responsiveness, quick loading times, and clear buttons help create a positive
                  experience. In a world where many businesses compete online, focusing on user experience is crucial for standing
                  out and attracting customers

              <h2>The Importance of Good Looks</h2>
              <p>
                The look of a website is very important because it creates the first impression for visitors. A visually appealing website can grab attention and encourage people to stay and check out what’s inside. Using the right colors, fonts, and images helps show what a brand is all about and builds trust with visitors. A well-designed website should not only look good but also work well, making it easy for users to find information. When a website combines great design with easy navigation, it can help a business succeed online.
